JDK vs JRE vs JVM vs JIT 

JDK : Java development kit 
      JRE + development tools 
      provides Environment and development tools to create , develop and run the Java program 
      it includes JRE which is used to run the Java Program 
      it has compiler named "javac", archiver - "jar" , doc generator - javadoc
      It also has an interpreter and a loader 

    JRE : Java Runtime Environment 
          JVM + library classes 
          It is an installation package that provides Environment only for runnig the program .
          It consists of Deployment technologies , Base libraries , JVM
          After we get .class file , the next things happen at run time i.e at JRE . 
            1. Class loader loads the all the classes needed to execute the program 
            2.JVM sends code to byte code verifier to check for the code format 

        JVM : Java Virtual Machine 

            JIT : Just in Time compiler
