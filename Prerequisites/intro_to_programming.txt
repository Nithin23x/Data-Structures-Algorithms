Static vs Dynamic Programming languages 

Staic : Performs type checking at compile time 
        Errors will show at compile time  .    
        Declare datatypes before using it . More control over code

        ex : int a = "Computer" -- Error at compile time 


Dynamic : Performs type checking at run time 
          Errors may show at runtime 
          No need to declare the datatypes of variables 

          ex : a = "Laptop"
               a = 10       --- No Error 

There are two types of memory in memory management 
    a.Stack 
    b.Heap 

    The variables are stored in type of objects . it means every variable assigned is an object referenced by the variable name 

    a.Stack : The stack memory consists of the variable namespace/referenced variable where it stores the names of the variables .
              And these variables point to the value of the variable known as object
    
    b.Heap  : The heap memory consists of the variable's value stored as object . Multiple variable names can point to single object in heap memory

    ex : a = [1,3,4,5]
         b = a 
         c = a      -- Here a,b,c are namespaces in stack memory all pointing to the [1,3,4,5] object in heap memory

         if b[1] =7 -- Here we are not only changing the value of b[1]th element but also the variables a and c are pointing to the same object
                        so the change will be reflected in variable a and c also
