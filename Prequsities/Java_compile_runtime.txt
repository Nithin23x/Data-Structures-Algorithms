First the .java file will be compiled by the compiler "javac" present in the JDK. 
it will be converted into .class file known as byte code

this byte code then will be taken to next steps 
     1. class loader , where the it reads the .class file and generates the binary data 
     this .class file will be created an object where it is saved in the heap . 

     2. Linking : JVM checkes the byte code(.class file) for any possible errors 
        Allocates the space for class variables 
        the referenced variables are now replaced with direct heap referenced values 

    3. Initialazation : All static variables are now assigned with their in the  code 

    4. interpreter : Line by line code interpretaiton and repeated methods and functions are interpreted again and again 

    5. JIT compiler : The repeated methods are now assigned to direct machine code so that repeating will be reduced and code excution is faster
    
             Garbage collector : it is used to remove unused and unassigned data . It is triggered automatically .
